# Hello, I’m Connor.

I’m a product leader and strategist in Chicago, currently working on the [McDonald’s app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mcdonalds/id922103212). I’m passionate about human-centric product design, accessible software, and digital privacy. I like coffee, Marvel movies, and talking with my hands.

I use this Github account to store the source code for my website projects and experiments with SwiftUI. Contributions or suggestions on public repos are more than welcome.
